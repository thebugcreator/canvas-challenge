1. Get started
 - Open command prompt (Windows) or other command-line interfaces that support initiating Java.
It depends on the system you are using for running this application.
 - Choose the project directory.
 - There is a jar file named "CryptoCanvasChallenge.main.jar" in the
chosen directory.
 - Ask Java to run the jar file: "java -jar CryptoCanvasChallenge.main.jar"
do not forget to press Enter :D
 - The application is now running, you can start typing commands to work with it.

2. Functionality
 - The command list is the same as ones stated in the Software Requirement Specification.
For your convenience, I will shortlist them here:
	C w h: Creates a new canvas with desired width w and height h.

	R x1 y1 x2 y2: Draws a rectangle with (x1;y1) as the upper left corner and
 (x2;y2) as the lower right corner.
	B x y c: Fills the surrounding of (x;y) by colour c.
	Q: Quit this application.
